Multithreading

The cpu often referred to as the brain of the computer, is responsible
for executing instruction from programs.
It performs basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output
operations specific specified by the instructions.

core is the individual processing unit within a cpu. Modern Cpu's can have multiple cores,
allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.


quad core means -> four tasks simultaneously

process is instance of program that is being executed

Thread:
The smallest unit of exexution within a process.
A process can have multiple threads, which shre the same resources but can run independently


Multitasking : It allow an operating system to run multiple processes simultaneosly

Multithreading refers to the ability to execute multiple threads within a single process concurrently.

Multitasking can be achieved through multithreading where each task divided into threads
that are managed concurrently.


Java provides robust support for multithreading, allowing developers to create application that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously,
improving performance and responsiveness

A thread is a lightweight process ,
the smallest unit of processing. Java supports multithreading through its java.lang.
Thread class and the java.lang.Runnable interface.

To create a new thread in java, you can either extend the Thread class or implement the Runnable interface
